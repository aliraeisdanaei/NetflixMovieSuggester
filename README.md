# NetflixMovieSuggester

This program is a simple web scraper that uses bs4 to read off of [this website](https://www.finder.com/ca/netflix-movies) all of the movies on netflix. 

The user can enter their preferances for which movies they would like to see, and the program will save these as a text file. Every time the program is run, the user can login to their account with their preferances saved. 
The movie recommendations are exhaustive. 

In case the website changes or there is a new website the scraper can be easily modified thanks to the modular design of the program.
